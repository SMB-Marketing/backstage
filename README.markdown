Backstage
=========

This is the source for Backstage, originally from the [SIMILE SVN
repository][1].  We expect to see this satisfy the need for a
server-side backend working with [Exhibit 3.0][2].

Usage
-----

You will need a JVM installed with appropriate enviornment settings
(`JAVA_HOME`, etc).  You will also need [SIMILE Butterfly][3] installed
in a peer directory to Backstage, like:

```
src/
  backstage/
  butterfly/
```

Butterfly can be checked out from the SIMILE repository with SVN.
